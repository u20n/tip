        <h2>Do Your Research Before You Buy</h2>
        <p1> The Indian ARts and Crafts Act of 1990 prohibits
          the creation or sale of any fasley advertised products.
          These purchases leach off the pain of the Native American community,
          and indirectly undercut their economic options.

          “It is illegal to offer or display for sale,
          or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it
          is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular
          Indian or Indian Tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization,
          resident within the United States.”

          Thankfully, the FTC provides <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0179-buying-american-indian-arts-and-crafts">resources</a>
          to determine the legitimacy of commercial products claiming to be
          of Native American origin.

        <h2>The Indigenous Genocide</h2>
        <p1> From the abstract; <br> "During the past century, researchers have learned a great deal about the nature and
          scope  of  what  Russell  Thornton  has  called  the  demographic  collapse  of  the  Indigenous
          population in the Western Hemisphere after 1492.1 As David Stannard has explained, the
          almost inconceivable number of deaths caused by the invasion and conquest of these lands
          by Europeans and their descendants constitute “the worst human holocaust the world had
          ever witnessed.”2 Scholars have long had reliable information on the size of the Indigenous
          population in this hemisphere and this country at its nadir around the turn of the twentieth
          century. And in recent decades, investigators have developed a range of estimates of the
          Native population in the Western Hemisphere before 1492. Researchers have also amassed
          considerable knowledge about the role of diseases, wars, genocidal violence, enslavement,
          forced  relocations,  the  destruction  of  food  sources,  the  devastation  of  ways  of  life,
          declining birth rates, and other factors in the Indigenous Holocaust.3 This paper draws on
          the work of Russell Thornton, David Stannard, and other scholars in attempting to count
          the dead—that is, in developing informed and reasonable, if very rough, estimates of the
          total loss of Indigenous lives caused by colonialism in the Western Hemisphere and in what
          is  today  the  United  States  of  America.  Although  this  analysis  is  inevitably  grim  and
          saddening, there is much to be gained by understanding the most sustained loss of life in
          human history—both for people living today and for future generations.""
