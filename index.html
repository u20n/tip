        <h2>Do Your Research Before You Buy</h2>
        <p1> The Indian ARts and Crafts Act of 1990 prohibits
          the creation or sale of any fasley advertised products.
          These purchases leach off the pain of the Native American community,
          and indirectly undercut their economic options.

          “It is illegal to offer or display for sale,
          or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it
          is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular
          Indian or Indian Tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization,
          resident within the United States.”

          Thankfully, the FTC provides <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0179-buying-american-indian-arts-and-crafts">resources</a>
          to determine the legitimacy of commercial products claiming to be
          of Native American origin.
